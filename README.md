# Project-4 : A Laptop Price Prediction Model - A Model Predicting How Prices Change Based On Individual Components of a Given Laptop
## Objective
This model's primary goal is to use a machine learning algorithm to predict the prices of laptops based on their individual components. The objective is to help consumers make better purchasing decisions by giving them a frame of reference for how a given laptop should be priced.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eslamelsolya/laptop-price-prediction


## Proposed Methodology
1) Load the dataset and clean it by handling missing values, duplicate entries, and formatting inconsistencies.
2) Convert categorical features into a numerical format using different techniques.
3) Extract meaningful features from CPU, GPU, and Memory
4) Standardize or normalize numerical variables
5) Query and filter relevant data dynamically.
6) Train regression models (Random Forest And Neural Net)
7) Evaluate models using RÂ² score

## Key Questions
1) What factors contribute the most to laptop price prediction?
2) What model provides the best accuracy for predicting price?
